      "**Highlights:**\n",
      "- Koval is a simulation, evaluation, and monitoring platform for AI agents, starting with voice and chat agents, and applying lessons learned from Waymo's self-driving car testing.\n",
      "- The platform helps companies balance precision versus scalability by enabling comprehensive testing across many conversation flows while maintaining high signal quality.\n",
      "- Key conversational agent evaluation strategies include reference-free metrics, workflow validation, function call validation, and comparison to human performance benchmarks.\n",
      "- Companies are building redundancy into AI agents through techniques like fallback mechanisms, self-healing capabilities, and human backup options.\n",
      "- The development of reliable AI agents will likely follow a similar path to cloud infrastructure, building robust systems from inherently unreliable components through redundancy and engineering.\n",
