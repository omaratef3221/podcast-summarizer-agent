      "857: How to Ensure AI Agents Are Accurate and Reliable â€” with Brooke Hopkins\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Output Format:**\n",
      "**Highlights:**\n",
      "- Koval is a simulation, evaluation, and monitoring platform for AI agents, starting with voice and chat agents, and applying lessons learned from Waymo's self-driving car testing.\n",
      "- The platform helps companies balance precision versus scalability by enabling comprehensive testing across many conversation flows while maintaining high signal quality.\n",
      "- Key conversational agent evaluation strategies include reference-free metrics, workflow validation, function call validation, and comparison to human performance benchmarks.\n",
      "- Companies are building redundancy into AI agents through techniques like fallback mechanisms, self-healing capabilities, and human backup options.\n",
      "- The development of reliable AI agents will likely follow a similar path to cloud infrastructure, building robust systems from inherently unreliable components through redundancy and engineering.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Resources:**\n",
      "- **Koval**: A simulation, evaluation, and monitoring platform for AI agents, providing tools for comprehensive testing and validation of conversational agents.\n",
      "- **Waymo**: A self-driving car project that has developed advanced simulation and testing techniques for autonomous vehicles, which are being applied to the development of AI agents.\n",
      "- **Y Combinator**: A startup accelerator that provides funding, resources, and support to early-stage companies, including Koval.\n",
      "- **Creativity Inc.**: A book by Ed Catmull that provides insights into building creative and innovative companies, which has informed Brooke's approach to building Koval.\n",
      "- **Kim Stanley Robinson's books**: Such as \"Ministry for the Future\", which provide a realistic and thought-provoking vision of the future, and can help readers think about the potential implications of emerging technologies like AI agents.\n"
